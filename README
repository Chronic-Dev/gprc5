Remaining bugs to fix:

* modify the build system so that we can do : make PRODUCTION=1
  * in PRODUCTION builds :
    - iBSS* iBoot* kernelcache* files have to be downloaded at each try. It'll fix lot of issues.
    - serial=1 is removed from boot-args
  * add a NOSERIAL build too

* this idea of PRODUCTION builds started with iBSS* iBoot* kernelcache* file problems. If we can do it by checking MD5 of files, there's no need for it right now.

* gp limera1n exploit implementation is not as stable as redsn0w's , certainly on Mac only.
	~ is this a i386/x86_64 problem?

* comex's saying the USB stuff of gp crashes is Mac :/

* Lepoard (10.5) has issues finding /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib

* people with Verizon, Mac & RC5.4 reports the issue that the "Application kills itself", I also had a twitt about not using the aftermarket cable (?)

* hacktivation

* Windows 7 stability issues: shows iBSS white screen and say Failed. XP Compatible mode seems to do the trick.

* lockdownd poping up a progress bar when Loader extracts cydia package on certain devices (certainly previously jailbroken devices updated to 4.2.1.)

* Remarks on AppleTV DFU instructions:
  iH8sn0w: Alright, when greenpois0n is done booting the ramdisk for the Apple TV, it needs power to continue executing the ramdisk. But greenpois0n says that the Jailbreak is complete. So people will unplug the usb to the apple tv which will interrupt the ramdisk executing.
  iH8sn0w: Its not like an iDevice where you see the actual progress on a display.
  iH8sn0w: nor does the Apple TV have a battery 

* AppleTV no Apple showing on boot issue:
  iH8sn0w: One odd thing though is that the apple logo doesnt pop up anymore on boot

* pod2g: I can't get why animate_start() is called multiple times in launchd.c
