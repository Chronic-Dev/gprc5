Remaining bugs to fix:

* modify the build system so that we can do : make PRODUCTION=1
  * in PRODUCTION builds :
    - iBSS* iBoot* kernelcache* files have to be downloaded at each try. It'll fix lot of issues.
    - serial=1 is removed from boot-args
  * add a NOSERIAL build too

* Verizon CMDA iPhone3,3: the BDID is now 6
