Remaining bugs to fix:

* modify the build system so that we can do : make PRODUCTION=1
  * in PRODUCTION builds :
    - iBSS* iBoot* kernelcache* files have to be downloaded at each try. It'll fix lot of issues.
    - serial=1 is removed from boot-args
  * add a NOSERIAL build too

* this idea of PRODUCTION builds started with iBSS* iBoot* kernelcache* file problems. If we can do it by checking MD5 of files, there's no need for it right now.

* gp limera1n exploit implementation is not as stable as redsn0w's , certainly on Mac only.
	~ is this a i386/x86_64 problem?

* comex's saying the USB stuff of gp crashes is Mac :/

* Lepoard (10.5) has issues finding /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib

* people with Verizon, Mac & RC5.4 reports the issue that the "Application kills itself", I also had a twitt about not using the aftermarket cable (?)

* hacktivation

* Windows 7 stability issues: shows iBSS white screen and say Failed. XP Compatible mode seems to do the trick.

* sandbox issues with iBooks and DRM'd Books

* non working gpsPhone

* lockdownd poping up a progress bar when Loader extracts cydia package on certain devices (certainly previously jailbroken devices updated to 4.2.1.)
